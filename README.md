**FG_Mechs** - A DHSVM output post-processing workflow that analyzes and visualizes changes in flood-generating mechanisms (i.e., rain-on-snow events, extreme precipitation, or snowmelt) based on basin conditions at the time of the peak flow.   

**Peak_Flows** - A DHSVM output post-processing workflow that analyzes and visualizes changes in peak flow magnitude and frequency.   

**Streamflow** - Various post-processing scripts were used to evaluate model accuracy (calibration) and analyze and visualize changes in monthly streamflows based on 30-year normals.  

The majority of the figures in my thesis were generated using ArcGIS Pro and R scripts. See thesis figures [here](https://cedar.wwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2196&context=wwuet).
